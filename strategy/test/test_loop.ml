(* Recurrence semantics suite: [recurrence body] starts its knot as
   [Pending], runs [body] from the first bar, and feeds each result back on
   the next bar. Bodies use [is_pending] + [cond] when they need an explicit
   bootstrap. Each scenario runs a fresh graph against a hand-computed or
   reference-recurrence expectation. *)
