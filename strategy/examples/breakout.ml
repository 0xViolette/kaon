(* Volatility-shock entry + ATR trailing stop, under the recurrence
   semantics: [recurrence body] starts its knot as [Pending] and runs
   [body] from the first bar, feeding each result back on the next bar.
   There is no warmup bookkeeping — a body that needs a seed selects it
   with [cond (is_pending prev) seed ...] while the knot is pending.

   Strategy:
   - ENTRY: close jumps >5% over the previous close (unknown bar).
   - FILL:  latch the close of the shock bar.
   - STOP:  once in, trail max(prev_stop, close - 2*ATR(6)); exit when
     close falls through the stop.

   Act A (the mistake): an unbootstrapped stop loop. The knot starts
   [Pending] and [max prev trail] never escapes it — [Pending] in,
   [Pending] out, forever. The stop is dead; the exit never fires. (The
   fill survives only because its body selects [close] on the event bar
   without touching [prev] — bodies that use prev strictly have no such
   rescue.)

   Act B (the fix): event-driven and history-dependent seeds belong in
   the BODY, selected while the knot is pending (Pine's nz). [cond] gates
   the strategy on the entry event. No fixed bar arithmetic anywhere —
   the strategy starts whenever the event fires and the ATR happens to be
   ready. *)
